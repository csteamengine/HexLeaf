# HexLeaf
This project is my attempt to create my own NanoLeafs based on the project by hansjny and by adding alexa to it. This will allow me to not only control the colors and brightness of the lights with the Blynk app, 
but to also turn them on/off with Alexa. These lights will be in my home office, so I can say "Alexa, turn on the office" and she will turn all my office lights on, including the HexLeaf setup.
